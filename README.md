# Learning how to code using C++

Some examples of my C++ exercices solutions from Informatics Faculty of Barcelona's subject P1,P2 (Programming 1 and 2), EDA (Data Structures and Algorithmics). It was my really first programming language so now I am really comfortable with it. With this problems I was able to learn some basic concepts like a vector, a map, a list, a structure, a class or some basic algorithms like Dicotomic Search, backtracking or Graphs algoritmhs.
